# Salty Bot

This is juste a simple bot I made for fun after checking old projects I worked on when I was a student.
It detects keywords in a message, and choose a random reply from a suuported keyword defined in a dictionary file. Of course, to avoid spam, it can be configured to have a % of chances to reply.

It also support commands, you just need to add a .js file in the `jobs` folder.

## Set up

To run the bot, you just need NodeJS and access to internet. Just run `npm install` then `npm start` to start the bot.
